# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects – 100 Days of Code

This repository contains a collection of Data Science and Machine Learning projects completed as part of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy.

Each project focuses on a different concept or technique and is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and more.

---

## Topics Covered

- Data manipulation and analysis with `pandas`
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`
- Simple and multiple linear regression
- Classification tasks
- Time series exploration with Google Trends
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Real-world datasets

---

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ds-ml-lab/2025-udemy-100-days-python-pro-bootcamp.git
   cd 2025-udemy-100-days-python-pro-bootcamp
   ```

2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
